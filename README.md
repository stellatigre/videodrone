videodrone
==========

Videodrone is something of an interactive online art installation.  Given a keyword, it will produce a wall
of 9 videos from youtube based on the search term.  It's intended both as an overload of digital stimuli,
and a comment on pop culture in a way.

It's implemented in JS, very simply, via the youtube api.
